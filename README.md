# pysashimi

Pure python scripts to make sashimi plots

Why am I write this?

Cause I trying to integrate sashimi plots within Flask, rather than embed [JBrowse](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse) into it.

Thanks to [ggsashimi](https://github.com/guigolab/ggsashimi), I learned how to extract junctions and so on from BAM/SAM files

## requirments
```
seaborn==0.9.0
scipy==1.1.0
matplotlib==3.0.0
numpy==1.15.2
pysam==0.15.1
pyBigWig==0.3.12
```

## TO
- [ ] plot sashimi without bam file
