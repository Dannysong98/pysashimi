# pysashimi

Pure python scripts to make sashimi plots

Why am I write this?

Cause I trying to integrate sashimi plots within Flask, rather than embed [JBrowse](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse) into it.

Thanks to [ggsashimi](https://github.com/guigolab/ggsashimi), I learned how to extract junctions and so on from BAM/SAM files

```
pysam==0.15.1
